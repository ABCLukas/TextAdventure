You tell Sophie that it's probably better to try it with the spatula so the window doesn't break completely. You fail to open it, but then Sophie comes up with a smart idea, with physics and stuff that you don't understand, but she manages to open it. You jump out of the window, but you are not in the garden. You are in another room. There is nothing in it, but there are two stairs. One to go down and one to go up. 

You can decide again if you want to use the stairs to go down, then jump to page "7." Or if you want to go up, jump to page "6."
