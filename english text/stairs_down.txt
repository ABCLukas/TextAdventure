You’re in the basement now, and there you see a low light shining out under a door. You look around and see tools lying on the ground on your right side. Simon wants to go to the room and look why there’s light; maybe it’s better to throw the hammer at the door and wait for a reaction. You choose: do you want to go into the room (page 10) or throw something at the door (page 9).
