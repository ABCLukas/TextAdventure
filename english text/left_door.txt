You chose the left door... And you found the bathroom, but everything is destroyed in here; there is no medicine or even water; the only thing there is is blood. Its everywhere; you want to go out, even though you get dizzy, but you throw the floor because it was rotten. You lost because Walther t. is standing directly above you, binds all of you, and gives you k.o. pills. Later that evening, you get an operation, like Manuel, and all of you die.
