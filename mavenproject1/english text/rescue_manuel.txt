Like a hero, you grab that syringe, you jump Walther T. Chardonnay, he tries to just smile because he thinks you can't do anything against him, but you inject him with that syringe, and after only a few seconds, he starts to collapse. Simon is screaming at you, but you can't hear him anymore. Everything around you gets silent, and you feel dizzy. After a few seconds, you find yourself at home in your bed. Nothing of this ever happened; it was all just a big dream. 
END
