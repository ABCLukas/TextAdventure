<html>You went up. Good choice! After you go upstairs, you notice Emma is missing; she must be still downstairs. After a short discussion, you and your remaining friends decide not to go down because it's too risky. Upstairs is a long hallway, and there are a lot of doors. 
You go through the first door. It looks like the bedroom of a child. You notice nothing special besides a sharp knife. The other ones didn't see it; you just keep it in your back pocket, and you don't tell anyone about this because you think they wouldn't think this is good to keep because it's dangerous. 
You are going out of the bedroom and looking down the hallway; your friends are still behind you. You investigate another room, the storage room. You get scared because there is a scary baby doll with red eyes. You stumble and fall back; by falling back, you hurt yourself with the knife you found in the bedroom. Sophie has the idea to go to the bathroom to clean your wound and maybe find a bandage. You run to the end of the hallway; thereâ€™s a door on the right and one on the left. Do you want to go right or left? Left [left_door] Right [right_door]</html>
