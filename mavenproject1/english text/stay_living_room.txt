You stay in the living room, and after a few hours of searching for something, you find a pistol. Do you want to keep it?  

Do you want to drop it? [dropped_weapon]

You decided to keep it not long after you realized it was the right choice to save all of your lives. Walther T. Chardonnay just stands in front of you. Your reaction times are out of this world; he is not fast enough, and you fire the weapon one, two, three times directly into his heart. He falls down, and you see the keys in his pockets. Sophie grabs them, and she gets you out of there. As fast as you can, you run home. Now you are saved, and you made it. 
Congratulations!
