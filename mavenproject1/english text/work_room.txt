<html>You find yourself in the workroom. There is just one big problem: the light is not working. Still, there is a bit of sun in the room, and you see enough to not step on something that could lead you to fall and hurt you. While Sophie is trying to fix the light, you look for something to escape. Simon yells at you that he wants to get out of here and sleep. You yell back, and now he is offended, so he rushes out and lies down on the couch. Emma is pissed off again and gives you the excuse that he lies on the couch now. You don't listen and just search for something, and you really find something. An angle grinder. You call all your friends together, and you can decide if you want to destroy the main door. The problem is that Walther could hear it.(Stay on this page.)
So you decided to destroy the main door. You begin to destroy, but only a few seconds later the angle grinder doesn't work anymore; the door is not out of wood, and you didn't see it. As fast as you can, you try to run to the working room, but it's not working anymore, and in the moment where everything is only going downhill already, stand in your room. You tried to fight him, but without any chance. Then he binds all of you and gives you k.o. pills. Later that evening, you get an operation, like Manuel, and all of you die. LOST! 

Or you try to destroy a window in this room. [destroyed_window_work_room]</html>
