<html>You choose the right door; you open it and find the bathroom. You clean your wound, and instead of bandages, you use a piece of your t-shirt to cover the cut on your leg. Simon goes to the window to light a blunt because, after all his stress, he needs to calm down. As he stood by the window and looked out, he saw something very helpful for the group. “There’s a way out!” he shouts. Sophie answered with an angry voice: ”Shut up, you’re too stoned; you already see things that don’t exist." After this, Simon just stepped out the window, but he didn’t fall. You and your friends go to Simon to see why he didn’t fall. As you look out the window, you realize that Simon did not lie. Outside the window, you see old fire escape stairs. You are happy to finally leave the building, but you’re also sad because you lost Emma and Manuel. You ran down the stairs in front of the house, and suddenly you see a garden house in the middle of the garden. How didn't you notice it before? Simon opens it, and what is waiting there is now in the mind of every reader. Just think about what should be waiting there. </html>
