<html>Simon says you should keep it, but the two girls say no, so you listen to them, and you leave it there. Only 20 minutes later, something big stands in front of you; it's Walther T. Chardonnay. You jump for your life, trying to get the pistol again. But he stands again in front of you. It feels like he could teleport. Without any chance, he binds all of you and gives you k.o. pills. Later that evening, you get an operation, like Manuel, and all of you die. LOST! </html>
